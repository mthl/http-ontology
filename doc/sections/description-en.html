The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is, together with the logical addressing
(URI) and HTML, the basic building block of the Web.  While HTTP remains at the
heart of Web development, current enterprise information systems also use it
routinely for exchanges between heterogeneous programs: to this aim, all is
needed is an HTTP server on the one side and an HTTP client on the
other. Despite its apparent simplicity, the HTTP protocol is quite large, it
covers all aspects of client-server communications, while keeping it open for
potential evolutions. The size of the HTTP 1.1 specification which consists
currently in 8 IETF RFCs, refined and extended by other RFCs, demonstrates that
fact.  This specification defines constraints that impact not only the
implementers of Web Servers but also application developers that are
implementing request handlers: they need to ensure that their request handlers
conform to the semantics of HTTP.  Our goal is to formalize the HTTP
specification to be able to describe Web interactions in a sufficiently precise
way for enabling a mechanized verification of protocol conformance.  Since the
beginning of the Web, various proposals have been made to describe interactions
between Web clients and a Web server, with different means and objectives. Many
of them are "machine-readable" but are limited to the syntactic level and do
not rely on an ontological description of HTTP interactions.  The main
difficulty when describing Web interactions consists in taking into account the
presence of hypermedia links in the representation of the Web resources. The
point is that HTTP mixes the data and the control over that data. This makes
things easy for humans (developers) to interact with.  However it is hard to
describe it formally, and it is still difficult for machines to interact
robustly when using it.

The proposed ontology is a work in progress, compared to W3C HTTP Vocabulary in
RDF it addresses the following challenges:

1. HTTP message headers represent an associative array with heterogeneous value
   types: we provide a way to describe headers in a generic manner while
   enabling to express more precisions for specific ones such as the Location
   header whose value is linked to a new resource.

2. HTTP allows the usage of various representation formats in the body payload
   by making use of Media Type declarations. This variability is required for
   HTTP genericity, but it makes it difficult to formalize the interaction
   aspect of the protocol regarding the exchanged content: we propose a way to
   describe uniformly both the data and meta-data of messages for a subset of
   the allowed content types.  3) URIs primary goal is to identify a resource,
   however in the context of Web APIs the optional query part of the URI is
   extensively used to parameterize the behavior of the server request
   handler. We define a set of properties that can be used to represent the
   various parts of an URI, in particular query parameters.
